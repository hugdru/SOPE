Compilation instructions:
    The makefile in the root folder calls
    each of the 3 programs makefiles, repectively: index,
    csc and sw.

    makefile--------------|
     index/makefile-------|
     csc/makefile---------|
     sw/makefile----------|

    make (defaults to debug)
    make all (same as make)
    make debug (lots of warnings turned on and debugging support)
    make release (optimization and exploit protection)

    The executables are placed in the folder bin

    the object files are placed in
        index/buildtemp
        csc/buildtemp
        sw/buildtemp

Execution instructions:
